On the official website of Liv Pure, it is stated that the supplement is created based on a new scientific study that discovered the root cause of weight gain in men and women. The study found a common factor in people who are overweight and compromised liver function. As you all might know, the main function of the liver is to cleanse all toxins and chemicals from your body. But the liver also has another function that many aren’t aware of. This is determining whether the food that you eat should be burned as energy or stored as body fat and this is why your liver is called the fat-burning furnace. When your liver is not functioning, it will lead to fat accumulation in your body instead of burning them for energy.
